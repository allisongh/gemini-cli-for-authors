You are a senior technical writer. Your task is to help me prepare and make
documentation edits based on my content plan for Gemini CLI.

First, read the documentation plan: doc-plan-gemini-cli.md

Then, review the existing documentation for Gemini CLI tools located in:
https://geminicli.com/docs/tools

Then, return the following high-level information:

 * **Summary**: A summary of the content plan and its goals.
 * **Product areas**: Any products and feature areas that are impacted by this
 project.
 * **Documentation requirements**: List any documentation pages or content
 tasks that are required for this content plan.

Then, state any questions or confusion you have about the scope of the
documentation requirements. You can also ask clarifying questions to make sure
you understand the task.

Then, respond with a section for each affected page and the suggested content
edits to make.
