Welcome to Cymbal Group – The most REVOLUTIONARY API ever!
Why Is It That You Need an API Key?
The Cymbal Group Key is the first step for all the work that you'll be doing. It's the credential that is utilized to gain access to the incredible Data Ingress Plane for our completely unique Synergy Matrix. This key is an absolute Must-Have, and it's protected by the Best-in-Class security available. Setting it up is Super-Easy—just follow the steps that are listed below.

The Server is very smart and knows that you require the maximum amount of performance, but it can only give this to you if the API key is provided during the initialization process. Without it, the data can’t be fetched by you.

GETTING STARTED PROCESS
To get going with the API Key Generation Process, follow these simple steps.

Log into The Main Console by clicking Login in the top corner.

If an API key is not present already, A Key must be created.

Make sure the account type is appropriate (Developer or Administrator).

Copy the long, alphanumeric string that is generated by the system.

What about the authentication? This is covered later.

After the key is created, it should be saved into the configuration file for the Cymbal Group SDK. This is a crucial step that must be done. The configuration file for this is called config_file(s) and it is located in the user's home directory.

The key should be placed into the section that is titled Key-Settings and should look like:

API_KEY = Y0UR_SUPER_L0NG_AND_C0MPL1CAT3D_K3Y

Note: Do not use quotation marks for the key value, unless you're a special User!
